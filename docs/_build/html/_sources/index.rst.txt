DragonTravel is a plugin for the popular Bukkit-servermod which enables admins of Minecraft-servers to customize their servers.
It enables players to travel by riding on the back of dragons in Minecraft.

--------

* Allows admins to set destinations for the dragons.
* Allows players with the specific permission to summon and mount a dragon and...

  * ...fly flights which consists out of waypoints (as many as you like)
  * ...fly to destinations which have been set by an admin before.
  * ...fly to coordinates chosen via command.
  * ...fly to players choosen via command.
  * ...fly to your faction's home-position (Factions required)
  * ...fly to your town's spawn (Towny required)
  * ...fly to a home-position which has been set by this player earlier.

* Allows admins to set stations and limit the mounting of dragons to these locations (or a specified radius around it).
* Possibility to require a special item for players to use the plugin (e.g. a dragon-egg)
