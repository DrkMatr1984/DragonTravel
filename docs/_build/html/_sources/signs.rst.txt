Signs
=====

=======
General
=======

Signs give you the possibility to give players access to DragonTravel commands without them typing commands.
It is therefore a great way to increase the level immersion for role play servers.

At the moment, it is possible to bind the following actions to signs:
    * Starting a travel to a station
    * Starting a flight
    * Starting a travel to the player's faction's home point

**The basic layout of a sign in DragonTravel is the following:** ::

        [DragonTravel]
        <Action>
        <Target>
        [Cost]

The fourth line which contains the costs is optional. If you have economy-payment activated and the fourth line is empty, the player is charged the default cost set in the config
Costs have to be specified with a decimal seperator, even if you use payment via items (e.g. to charge a palyer 10 gold nuggets for a flight, specify "10.0" in the fourth line)
