Travels & Flights
=================

In DragonTravel there are two types of movement which differ in some ways.

I will explain the differences in the following:


A **travel** is a journey which brings a player to a target destination which always is a station.

A **flight** is a journey which takes the player along a predefined path which has been created by the admin before.


Both types of movement can be started from anywhere exept the admin configured that players have to be at a dragon station to start them or click a special sign.

While travels always end when the dragon reaches the specified target station, flights can have an unlimited amount of waypoints to show new players the server, enable players to enjoy a beautiful view or embed DragonTravel into the role-play atmosphere of a server.
